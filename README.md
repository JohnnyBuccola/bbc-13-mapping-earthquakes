# Module 13 - Earthquake Visualization
This repository contains a demonstration of visualization of GeoJSON data on a map by using Leaflet and Mapbox.js.  It also demonstrates usage of multiple interactive layers in with Leaflet. Each "Mapping_*" folder contains an example of mapping using different GeoJSON coordinate data types.  The Earthquake_Challenge folder displays earthquake data from the USGS on a map, using circles to indicate the magnitude of the earthquake.
